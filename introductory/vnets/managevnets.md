 ## What is Azure virtual networking?

 Azure virtual networks provide key capabilities:

- **Isolation and segmentation:**

    - Azure enables you to create multiple isolated virtual networks. You can then segment that IP address space into subnets.


- **Communicate to the internet:**

    - A VM in Azure can connect out to the internet by default. You can enable incoming connections from the internet by defining a public IP address or a public load balancer. For VM management, you can connect via the Azure CLI, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), or Secure Shell (SSH).


- **Communicate between Azure resources:**

    - Virtual networks can connect not only VMs, but other Azure resources, such as the App Service Environment, Azure Kubernetes Service, and Azure virtual machine scale sets.

    - You can use service endpoints to connect to other Azure resource types, such as Azure SQL databases and storage accounts. This approach enables you to link multiple Azure resources to virtual networks, thereby improving security and providing optimal routing between resources.

- **Communicate with on-premises resources:**

    - Point-to-site Virtual Private Networks

         The client computer initiates an encrypted VPN connection to Azure, connecting that computer to the Azure virtual network.

    - Site-to-site Virtual Private Networks 

        A site-to-site VPN links your on-premises VPN device or gateway to the Azure VPN gateway in a virtual network. In effect, the devices in Azure can appear as being on the local network. The connection is encrypted and works over the internet.

    - Azure ExpressRoute

        For environments where you need greater bandwidth and even higher levels of security, Azure ExpressRoute is the best approach. Azure ExpressRoute provides dedicated private connectivity to Azure that does not travel over the internet. 

- **Route network traffic:**

    By default, Azure will route traffic between subnets on any connected virtual networks, on-premises networks, and the internet. However, you can control routing and override those settings as follows:

    - Route tables

        A route table enables you to define rules as to how traffic should be directed. You can create custom route tables that control how packets are routed between subnets.

    - Border Gateway Protocol

        Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) works with Azure VPN gateways or ExpressRoute to propagate on-premises BGP routes to Azure virtual networks.

    - Filter network traffic

        Azure virtual networks enable you to filter traffic between subnets by using the following approaches:

        - Network security groups

            A network security group (NSG) is an Azure resource that can contain multiple inbound and outbound security rules. You can define these rules to allow or block traffic, based on factors such as source and destination IP address, port, and protocol.

        - Network virtual appliances

            A network virtual appliance is a specialized VM that can be compared to a hardened network appliance. A network virtual appliance carries out a particular network function, such as running a firewall or performing WAN optimization.

- **Connect virtual networks**

    You can link virtual networks together using virtual network peering. Peering enables resources in each virtual network to communicate with each other. These virtual networks can be in separate regions, allowing you to create a global interconnected network through Azure.

## VNet use cases

An Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is a representation of your own network in the cloud. It is a logical isolation of the Azure cloud dedicated to your subscription. 

VNets can be used in many ways:

- **Create a dedicated private cloud-only VNet:** Sometimes you don't require a cross-premises configuration for your solution. When you create a VNet, your services and VMs within your VNet can communicate directly and securely with each other in the cloud. You can still configure endpoint connections for the VMs and services that require internet communication, as part of your solution.

- **Securely extend your data center With VNets:** You can build traditional site-to-site (S2S) VPNs to securely scale your datacenter capacity.

- **Enable hybrid cloud scenarios:** VNets give you the flexibility to support a range of hybrid cloud scenarios. You can securely connect cloud-based applications to any type of on-premises system such as mainframes and Unix systems.

## Subnets 

Subnets provide logical divisions within your virtual network and a VNet can be segmented into one or more subnets. 

Each subnet contains a range of IP addresses that fall within the VNet address space. 

- The range must be unique within the address space for the virtual network.
- The range can't overlap with other subnet address ranges within the virtual network.
- The address space must be specified by using the Classless Inter-Domain routing (CIDR) notation.
- Azure reserves 5 IP addresses within each subnet. These are x.x.x.0-x.x.x.3 and the last address of the subnet. x.x.x.1-x.x.x.3 is reserved in each subnet for Azure services.

    - x.x.x.0: Network address
    - x.x.x.1: Reserved by Azure for the default gateway
    - x.x.x.2, x.x.x.3: Reserved by Azure to map the Azure DNS IPs to the VNet space
    - x.x.x.255: Network broadcast address for subnets of size /25 and larger. This will be a different address in smaller subnets.

## IP addressing

![alt text](img/3.png "Title")

- **Private IP addresses:** Used for communication within an Azure virtual network (VNet), and your on-premises network, when you use a VPN gateway or ExpressRoute circuit to extend your network to Azure.

- **Public IP addresses:** Used for communication with the Internet, including Azure public-facing services.


### Static vs Dynamic addresses assignments

IP addresses can also be statically assigned or dynamically assigned. 

Static IP addresses do not change and are best for certain situations such as:

- DNS name resolution, where a change in the IP address would require updating host records.
- IP address-based security models that require apps or services to have a static IP address.
- TSL/SSL certificates linked to an IP address.
- Firewall rules that allow or deny traffic using IP address ranges.
Role-based VMs such as Domain Controllers and DNS servers.

- Dynamic addresses can change when the resource is deallocated.

- Static addresses aren't released until a public IP address resource is deleted. If the address isn't associated to a resource, you can change the assignment method after the address is created.

## Demo

Let's create a VNet, three subnets, a VM in each one, make sure only Vm1 has a public IP, and make sure we can RDP into all, and ping all.

![alt text](img/4.svg "Title")


1. Create a resource group

    ```sh
    az group create -g vnetdemo-rg -l eastu2
    ```

2. Create a vnet and a subnet

    ```sh
    az network vnet create -g vnetdemo-rg -n Vnet1 --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16 --subnet-name Subnet1 --subnet-prefix 10.0.0.0/24
    ```
    The JSON output will give us details of what we just created, which we could also get by running the `az network vnet show` command.

3. Next let's create the Subnet2
    ```sh
    az network vnet subnet create --name subnet2 --vnet-name Vnet1 -g vnetdemo-rg --address-prefixes 10.0.2.0/24
    ```

    Let's run a query to make sure our Vnet1 has both subnets associated with it.

    ```sh
    az network vnet show -g vnetdemo-rg -n Vnet1 --query "subnets"
    ``` 
4. Next let's create the Subnet3
    ```sh
    az network vnet subnet create --name subnet3 --vnet-name Vnet1 -g vnetdemo-rg --address-prefixes 10.0.3.0/24
    ```

    Let's run a query to make sure our Vnet1 has all subnets associated with it.

    ```sh
    az network vnet show -g vnetdemo-rg -n Vnet1 --query "subnets"
    ``` 

5. Create VM1

    ``` sh
    az vm create -g vnetdemo-rg -l eastus2 --image  MicrosoftWindowsServer:WindowsServer:2016-Datacenter:latest --vnet-name demovnet1 -n vm1 --subnet Subnet1
    ```

    Since we are using a Windows VM, port 3389 is opened automatically when we create it. 

6. Create VM2

    ``` sh
    az vm create -g vnetdemo-rg -l eastus2 --image  MicrosoftWindowsServer:WindowsServer:2016-Datacenter:latest --vnet-name demovnet1 -n vm2 --subnet Subnet2
    ```

7. Create VM3

    ``` sh
    az vm create -g vnetdemo-rg -l eastus2 --image  MicrosoftWindowsServer:WindowsServer:2016-Datacenter:latest --vnet-name demovnet1 -n vm2 --subnet Subnet2
    ```

8. Remove the public IP from vm2

    ```sh
    az network nic ip-config update --name ipconfigvm2 -g vnetdemo-rg --nic-name vm2VMNIC --remove PublicIpAddress
    ```

    You can use this command if you need to get the NIC of your VM.

    ```sh
    az vm nic list -g vnetdemo-rg --vm-name vm2
    ```

    You can use this command if you need to get the ip-config of your nic VM

    ```sh
    az network nic ip-config list --nic-name vm2VMNIC -g vnetdemo-rg -o table
    ```

9. Remove the public IP from vm3

    ```sh
    az network nic ip-config update --name ipconfigvm2 -g vnetdemo-rg --nic-name vm3VMNIC --remove PublicIpAddress
    ```

    You can use this command if you need to get the NIC of your VM.

    ```sh
    az vm nic list -g vnetdemo-rg --vm-name vm2
    ```

    You can use this command if you need to get the ip-config of your nic VM

    ```sh
    az network nic ip-config list --nic-name vm2VMNIC -g vnetdemo-rg -o table
    ```

10. Now let's RDP in the public facing VM.
11. Next let's PING VM2 and VM3 from VM1.
12. Next let's RDP into VM2 from VM1
13. Finally let's RDP into VM3 from VM2.
